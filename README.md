# Steps to Run
<ol>
 <li>git clone https://github.com/b-utkarsh-01/async_music.git</li>
 <li>cd  <b>your-repo-name</b></li>
 <li>npm install <br/>
 This is the most important step. You need to install all the packages that your project depends on. The package.json file (which you did upload to Git) keeps a list of all these packages.</li>
